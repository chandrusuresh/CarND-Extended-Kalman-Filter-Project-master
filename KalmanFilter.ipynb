    "## Kalman Filter\n",
    "In this project, a demonstration of the Kalman filter is presented to estimate the position of a vehicle with LIDAR & RADAR sensors. This demonstration is based on a simulator developed by Udacity and was completed as part of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. The [Udacity github repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) for this project has all the details about the software used in the simulator and the installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Setup Instructions\n",
    "1. The project uses [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) for communication between the user-written algorithm and the simulator. Udacity has provided bash scripts to install this in both [Linux](https://github.com/chandrusuresh/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project-master/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh)/[Mac](https://github.com/chandrusuresh/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project-master/blob/master/install-mac.sh) environments. These scripts are included in this repo.\n",
    "2. The simulator can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Build Instructions (Linux/Mac)\n",
    "1. Clone this repo.\n",
    "2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`\n",
    "3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`\n",
    "4. Run it: `./ExtendedKF`\n",
    "This should setup a listener for the code to get data from the simulator.\n",
    "5. Launch the simulator from a terminal: `./`\n",
    "6. Select the Kalman Filter project and click start to start the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps should get any user in a Linux/Mac environment up and running with the code."

Note that while the plant is modeled by the constant velocity model, the acceleration is modeled as noise and the complete model is suitable for tracking on highways where speeds are approximately a constant for the majority of the time. The process noise model is described in a separate section below.\n",

    "## Kalman Filter\n",
    "The Kalman filter (also known as Linear Quadratic Estimator - LQE) is an algorithm that uses a series of sensor measurements to update the predictions of the states (unobserved/latent variables) from a known linear model of a plant. The algorithm takes into account noise in the sensor measurement as well as disturbanbes/inaccuracies in the plant model (in relation to the actual physical plant) to estimate the joint probability distribution over the unobserved variables at each sample time. The Kalman filter enables predictions to be updated when sensor measurements are available even if the measurements are made at irregular/infrequent intervals of time. The Kalman filter is also very extensible for fusing measurements from any number of sensors into the model for state estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use the LIDAR and RADAR as sensors to update the position and velocity of a vehicle. The Kalman filter is only suitable for linear models and therefore it is used to update the plant model predictions from LIDAR sensor measurements. For the RADAR, we use the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that is suitable for non-linear plant/sensor models. The EKF along with the extensions to the RADAR sensor model is detailed in the next section.\n",
